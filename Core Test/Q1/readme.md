# Explaination

## Static Position
This is the default position value for elements. In the static position, elements follow the normal flow of the document. They are not affected by the top, bottom, left, or right properties.

## Fixed Position
A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window). It stays fixed in its position even when the page is scrolled. The top, bottom, left, and right properties can be used to position the element.

## Sticky Position
A sticky position is a mix of relative and fixed positioning. The element is positioned relative to its normal position within the document flow until it reaches a specified threshold (defined by top, bottom, left, or right properties), at which point it becomes fixed to the viewport.

## Relative Position
When an element is positioned relatively, it is placed in its normal position within the document flow, but it can be adjusted using the top, bottom, left, or right properties. The adjusted position is relative to its normal position.

## Absolute Position
An element with the absolute position is removed from the normal document flow. It is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor element that has a position value other than static) or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor exists. The top, bottom, left, and right properties can be used to position the element precisely.
